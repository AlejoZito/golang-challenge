# golang-challenge

Hi there 🙋‍♂️
Thanks for spending a few minutes reviewing this excercise

To run the app, just use
> go run main.go

I suggest reviewing the commits in order to see the thinking process and how I tackled the problem.

1. First i solved the requested problem as fast as possible
2. Then i added tests and a solution which iterated over the array. My first thought was that some kind of sort would be necessary, but i discovered that filling up an array with booleans would be sufficient and have the least space complexity
3. Lastly I added a json file to read the array, for extra fanciness and easy of testing
